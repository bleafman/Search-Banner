# Search-Banner

Search Bar and Banner Component for lazy-lowesing

# Overview

The goal of the lazy-lowesing is to take code from a previously built Lowe's site clone <a>https://github.com/mc-ed</a> and refactor for "webscale".

This means it's able to perform effectively with a dramatically larger product portfolio(+10M items) and handle a large number of request per second.

The project will also evaluate the efficicy of MongoDB vs Postgres.
